\noindent\begin{itemize*}
  \item{\begin{bf}Unique Visitor\end{bf}} - A unique visitor is a person
or computer (host) that has made at least 1 hit on 1 page of your web
site during the current period shown by the report. If this user makes
several visits during this period, it is counted only once.  Visitors
are tracked by IP address, so if multiple users are accessing your site
 from the same IP (such as a home or office network), they will be 
counted as a single unique visitor. The period shown by AWStats reports
 is by default the current month.\\
\\
However if you use AWStats as a CGI you can click on the ``year'' link to
have a report for all the year. In such a report, period is a full year,
so Unique Visitors are number of hosts that have made at least 1 hit on
1 page of your web site during the year.
\end{itemize*}
